# Operating Systems via Command Line


 This repository aims to focus on the practical aspects of the Operating System through the *command line*✨

 The command line inputs text commands instead of relying on a *graphical user interface or GUI* 🖱 If this is your first time using a command line for any OS, you maight find this repository little intimidating 😅 at first. That's totally normal, but you'll be good to go 😎 after referring to these scripts where I tried to cover most of the basic tasks that you may come across ✌
