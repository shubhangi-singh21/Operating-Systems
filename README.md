# Operating Systems via Command Line


 This repository aims to focus on the practical aspects of the Operating System through the *command line* 👩‍💻

 The command line inputs text commands instead of relying on a graphical user interface or GUI 🖱 If this is your first time using a command line for any OS, you maight find this repository little intimidating at first. That's totally normal, but you'll be good to go after referring to these scripts where I tried to cover most of the basic tasks that you may come across.
 
 ### This repository covers two operating systems:
 
 👉 Linux
 
 👉 Windows
